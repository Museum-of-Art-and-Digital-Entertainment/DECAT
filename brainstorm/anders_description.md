The spread sheet inventory is not meant to replace a proper library system. It is just a reassessment of our collection for a number of operational needs including budgeting out proper archiving materials. Right now most of operations is running off of head cannon lists for software and hardware. The fun thing is that we can also use the spreadsheets to build lists for website rather easily to show aspects of our collection. But I don't expect that to be the endpoint as a proper collection website, like CA. The University of Toronto took what they did with the spreadsheets and is still accessing the entries into their library system for more complete documentation.

- Because we are operating with a limited budget of time and money to assess the collection in the short term we are using a spreadsheet to assess the collection.
- This will give us an understanding of what we have and where it is. Currently this knowledge is outdated or in the head of a few individuals.
- Using a similar more product less process system (MPLP) to what the University of Toronto used to assess the 4000 piece Syd Bolton collection and our current identification system.
- The basics of which are using boxes which have location information and then associating those boxes to the different artifacts.
- The nice thing is that this can be done with little training and entries can be done in a very short amount of time. There are already more than 600 games inventoried in ~4 hours. (There ares some errors on the sheet that need to be fixed. Some entries are missing IDs.)

The spreedsheet can then be used in a variety of ways:
- A map to find items for exhibits and events
- A way of assessing our assets
- Budgeting for preservation materials and equipment
- (To name a few)

Then we can do as the University of Toronto is currently still doing with the Syd Bolton collection and create entries for each item in a library database so other institutions can utilize our collection.
