# Mason Requirements

Yes, in a quick blurb: we want to create shareable knowledge about the artifacts and objects within the MADE collection so they can be used toward our mission. I believe our mission to inspire and educate digital creators is made most enticing by the playable exhibits and event exhibits we can share at and beyond the museum. A useful collection is one that helps volunteers create exhibits and event boxes. A useful collection is made powerful by making it as easy to contribute to as possible.


If we want to build an academic collection, it should be an evolution of the collection data we can create easily with volunteers. For example, if we wanted to add all of the software, we just tagged at the volunteer event to CA, we need to take a picture of the front and back of each cartridge and write descriptions based on the pictures. Volunteers on site could take the pictures at the next volunteer collections event or as available. Online volunteers could make CA entries using the data from the spreadsheet collection and linked photos.
To me, being ready to adapt and make use of previous data while iterating our system seems to provide more utility than trying to imagine any final destination for the collection. Especially since our policy is open to all sorts of items, I believe it is useful to have layers to the collection we can work through with all kinds of people. The collection can be used however anyone in our community is purposing if we agree on it. So to me, flexibility is tantamount to the development of an increasingly useful collection.


Last Saturday we had a volunteer event that was focused on the collection and it went really well! This Monday we had a collections themed volunteer coordination meeting, continued some of the work that was being done. The near goal is to get a good idea of what we have onsite, while cataloging software. We are doing this so that we can migrate what we don’t need offsite and move what is offsite that we could need on site into operational storage. By knowing what software we have, we can create event boxes we can use for various community and school programs, as well as answer the most common question we get when offering private exhibits for museum bookings: what do we have?
The typical answer I provide doesn’t have much range beyond a private console of any system we have on the floor. (I do offer special showings of the vectrex, the virtual boy, our halo lan set up, and special accessories)


Knowing exactly which games we have in the game cabinet and giving each game there a MADE ID would do wonders for keeping track of how many games we have available for play on the floor via physical media
Right now that’s not even a sheet. It’s just a document that we print and put out next to the systems. Lots of room for improvement! Lots of low hanging fruit between the ID’ing and testing of the games. We could finally answer “how many games” with a more accurate description of our physical and digital counts.


Anyway; looking forward to a collections meeting!
I plan to run the volunteer event again every third Saturday of the month. The following Monday will be a collections themed volunteering coordination meeting. That way we can get more people involved with the collection since it’s definitely a part of what empowers people to work on their projects. (I have some user stories here if anyone wants to hear read them I’ll get them up into the drive)


I believe that the collection is a great theme for these volunteer event days because there’s a lot of labor involved.


August 17th (volunteer event 1-4pm) and August 19th (volunteer meeting 6pm-8pm)
I’ll finalize these shortly with calendar entries, but I am open to any and all feedback!


Also, happy to meet before these dates about any of this! When the museum is open, it’s open to collections work!
