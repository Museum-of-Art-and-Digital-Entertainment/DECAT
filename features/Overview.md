# Overview of Primary Features
Given the immediate needs of the museum, DECAT provides two solutions that address both immediate as well as long-term timelines. These will be called Inventory (immediate-term) and Catalog (long-term).

## Inventory
A ruthlessly immediate implementation of existing items in the collection that captures:
- The presence of the artifact in the collection
- A descriptive identifier of the artifact
- A unique identifier for tracking the artifact
- The location of the artifact within the museum's facilities
### Features
- A user can easily add an entry of an artifact into the Inventory System
- A user can search for whether or not the item is in the museum's Inventory System
- A user can find the artifact within the museum's facilities using the Inventory System
- A user can easily change the location of the artifact in the Inventory System

# Catalog
`Description here`
### Features
- A super user can determine access control of sub-users
